## Encryption Management
{: .no_toc }
AWS infrastructure storage services like AWS EBS, EFS, and RDS utilize AWS Key Management Store (KMS) for encryption, ensuring a 
robust layer of security.

## End User Authentication
{: .no_toc }
The NBS 7 system will support end user authentication by integrating with a standards-based SSO system. It is designed to be deployed 
as a protected endpoint within your preexisting SSO ecosystem, and can be configured to work with a wide variety of standards compliant 
Identity Providers (e.g. Okta, AD).

This is similar to NBS 6. As documented in ["NEDSS Base System Release 4.4.1 Hardening NBS Perimeter Security"](https://cdcnbscentral.com/attachments/1995) (September 20, 2012 Requires access on NBS central), NBS 6 does not authenticate users. Instead, it delegates authentication to a security proxy, which each 
State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial (STLT) must provide in order to deploy NBS.

The NBS 7 release requires that prospective users already have a working NBS 6 instance, and therefore assumes that a user 
authentication mechanism is already in place.

NBS 7 extends functionality that is available to the authenticated user. NBS 7 therefore works alongside the existing authentication 
mechanism. No additional steps are needed to authenticate users for NBS 7. 

To assist those who are integrating NBS into their SSO ecosystem, a proof of concept in which authentication is performed using an 
Identity Provider (IdP) and a proxy is available on request. To request it, [please create a ticket here](https://cdcnbscentral.com/projects/nbs700/issues/new)

## Management Machine Setup
{: .no_toc }
You will also need a local or cloud hosted workstation (e.g. CloudShell) with the set of tools required to configure, deploy and maintain the 
NBS 7 system. The following tools should be installed on a local or cloud-based management machine to support this work:

- **AWS CLI**: Download and installation instructions can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

- Instructions for getting and using AWS credentials for use with the CLI can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)

- **GitHub CLI**: Download and installation instructions are here:  
  [https://cli.github.com/](https://cli.github.com/)

- **Terraform CLI**: Download and installation instructions are [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)  
  *(Tested through 1.5.5 Terraform, suggest install that specific version rather than the latest non-open source version)*

- **Helm CLI**: Download and installation instructions are [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

- **Kubernetes CLI**: Download and installation instructions are [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html)

- **Optional, but nice to have, eksctl**: Download and installation instructions are [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html)

## Network and Database Access
{: .no_toc }
Installation of the NBS 7 Modern infrastructure and microservices will occur using a new VPC, which is provisioned using the Terraform scripts included in the steps below. 

You must ensure that there is network access available from the location of modern NBS 7 components to the classic NBS 6 components, including the database server. The database server or RDS should allow access to the nbs7 vpc address space. As a best practice, it is recommended to use a private route for this network access, rather than making it publicly accessible. 

Furthermore, you should have a team member who is familiar with Terraform and has experience using it to create infrastructure. This individual should have operational knowledge of Terraform, even if they are not a dedicated Terraform developer.
