# AWS Infrastructure 
### Installation Guide & Smoke Tests
{: .no_toc }

Installation of NBS 7 has three major phases. In the first phase you set up the environment and infrastructure, including k8s, in AWS, 
primarily by using Terraform. In the second phase you start up the workloads/pods in k8s, primarily using Helm (with a bit more Terraform).

Finally, you validate the release by performing a smoke test and inspecting monitoring/console/admin interfaces for the NBS service and
NiFi.


### NBS 7 Deployment
This guide sets out the detailed steps to installing NBS 7 end to end.
Make sure you’re using the latest documentation from NBS Central ( NBS Central)
1. System Administrator Guide (this document)
2. User Guide
3. Release Notes

Installation is divided into two sections:

1. **Terraform Deployment** - installs the core infrastructure
2. **Deployment to Kubernetes** - bootstrap core kubernetes infrastructure services & install and configure microservices (elasticSearch,
page-builder, modernization-api, nifi, nbs-gateway, data-ingestion, data-processing, real-time reporting services and nnd)

### Terraform Deployment 
1. Download the Terraform configuration package from GitHub. Make sure you go through the release page and see what's included in
the current release on [CDCgov/NEDSS-Infrastructure](https://github.com/CDCgov/NEDSS-Infrastructure/releases)
2. Open bash/mac/cloudshell/powershell and unzip the current version file downloaded in the previous step named nbs-infrastructure-
vX.Y.Z zip.
3. Create a new directory with an easily identifiable name e.g <nbs7-mySTLT-test> in /terraform/aws/ to hold your environment specific
configuration files
4. Copy terraform/aws/samples/NBS7_standard to the new directory and change into the new directory (Note: the samples directory
contains other options than “standard”, view the README file in that directory to chose most appropriate starting point)
```bash
cp -pr terraform/aws/samples/NBS7_standard terraform/aws/nbs7-mySTLT-test
cd terraform/aws/nbs7-mySTLT-test
```
**NOTE**: Before editing **terraform.tfvars** and **terraform.tf** files below, you may reference detailed information for each TF module under the
“terraform/aws/app-infrastructure” in a readme file in each modules directory. Do not edit files in the individual modules.
5. Update the terraform.tfvars and terraform.tf with your environment-specific values by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/CDCgov/NEDSS-Infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/aws/samples/NBS7_standard/README.md)
6. Review the inbound rules on the security groups attached to your database instance and ensure that the CIDR you intend to use with your NBS 7 VPC (modern-cidr) is allowed to access the database.
    - a. For e.g if the modern-cidr from the Table-1 is 10.20.0.0/16, there should be at least one rule in a security group associated to your database that allows MSSQL inbound access from your modern-cidr block
    ![mssql-inbound-from-modern-cidr](/just-the-doc/docs/3_base_application/myssql-inbound-from-modern-cidr.png)
7. Make sure you are authenticated to AWS. Confirm access to the intended account using the following command. (More information about authenticating to AWS can be found at the following [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).)
```
$ aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "AIDBZMOZ03E7R88J3DBTZ",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/lincolna"
}
```
8. Terraform stores its state in an S3 bucket. The commands below assume that you are running Terraform authenticated to the same AWS account that contains your existing NBS 6 application. Please adjust accordingly if this does not match your setup.
   - a. Change directory to the account configuration directory if not already, i.e. the one containing terraform.tfvars, and terraform.tf
    ```
    cd terraform/aws/nbs7-mySTLT-test
    ```
   - b. Initialize Terraform by running:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
   - c. Run “terraform plan” to enable it to calculate the set of changes that need to be applied:
    ```
    terraform plan
    ```
    Note: One warning is expected (due to a bug in the Hashicorp EKS module):
    ```
    Warning: Argument is deprecated
    with module.eks_nbs.module.eks.aws_eks_addon.this["aws-ebs-csi-driver"],
    on .terraform/modules/eks_nbs.eks/main.tf line 392, in resource "aws_eks_addon" "this":
    392:   resolve_conflicts        = try(each.value.resolve_conflicts, "OVERWRITE")
    The "resolve_conflicts" attribute can't be set to "PRESERVE" on initial resource creation. Use "resolve_conflicts_on_create" and/or "resolve_conflicts_on_update" instead
    ```
    ![terraform-plan](/just-the-doc/docs/3_base_application/terraform-plan.png)
   - d. Review the changes carefully to make sure that they 1) match your intention, and 2) do not unintentionally disturb other configuration on which you depend. Then run “terraform apply”:
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```
    e. If terraform apply generates errors, review and resolve the errors, and then rerun step d.
9. Verify Terraform was applied as expected by examining the logs
10. Verify the [newly created VPC and subnets](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-east-1#Home:) were created as expected and confirm that the CIDR blocks you defined exist in the Route Tables
11. Verify the [EKS Kubernetes cluster](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home?region=us-east-1#/clusters) was created by selecting the cluster and inspecting Resources->Pods, Compute (expect 30+ pods at this point, and 3-5 compute nodes as per the min/max nodes defined in terraform/aws/app-infrastructure/eks-nbs/variables.tf)
12. Now that the infrastructure has been created using terraform, deploy Kubernetes (K8s) support services in the Kubernetes cluster via the following steps
    - a. Start the Terminal/command line:
        - i. Make sure you are still authenticated with AWS (reference the following [Configuration and credential file settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)).
        - ii. Authenticate into the Kubernetes cluster (EKS) using the following command and the [cluster name you deployed in the environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html)
           ```bash
           aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name <clustername> # e.g. cdc-nbs-sandbox
           ```
        - iii. If the above command errors out, check
           - There are no issues with the AWS CLI installation
           - You have set the correct AWS environment variables
           - You are using the correct cluster name (as per the EKS management console)
    - b. Run the following command to check if you are able to run commands to interact with the Kubernetes objects and the cluster.
      ```bash
      kubectl get pods --namespace=cert-manager
      ```
      The above command should return 3 pods.  If it doesn’t refresh the AWS credentials and repeat steps in 12 a.
      ```bash
      kubectl get nodes
      ```
13. Congratulations! You have installed your core infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster! Next, we will configure your cluster using helm charts.
